## Introduction

The Minute Server package is a critical component of the Minute IM app, responsible for managing user authentication, message routing, and data synchronization between clients. It leverages the power and safety of the Rust programming language to provide a reliable and efficient server infrastructure.

The server package incorporates industry best practices, such as secure communication protocols, robust error handling, and efficient data storage mechanisms, to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of user data. It follows a modular design, allowing easy extensibility and customization to suit specific deployment requirements.

## Installation

To get started with the Minute Server package, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `git clone https://github.com/eneshalat/minute.git` 
    
2.  Navigate to the cloned directory:
    
    `cd minute` 
    
3.  Ensure you have the latest stable version of Rust installed. You can find installation instructions for Rust at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
    
4.  Build the project using Cargo:

    `cargo build --release` 
    
5.  Once the build process completes, the compiled server binary will be available at `target/release/minute`.
    

## Configuration

The Minute Server package provides configuration options through environment variables. These variables can be set in a `.env` file located in the project root directory. Below are some commonly used variables:

-   `DATABASE_URL`: The URL of the MongoDB database to be used for storing user data. Example: `mongodb://localhost:27017/minute`.
-   `JWT_SECRET`: The secret key used for JSON Web Token (JWT) generation and validation.
-   `LOG_LEVEL`: The desired log level for server output (e.g., `info`, `debug`, `warn`).

You can customize these variables according to your deployment environment.

## Running as a Multi-Cluster Structure

The Minute Server package supports running as a multi-cluster structure to handle high traffic and provide fault tolerance. To run multiple instances of the server, you can use a process manager like `systemd` or container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

Each instance of the server should be started with a unique configuration, including a different port number and MongoDB replica set. Set the `PORT` environment variable to specify the port for each server instance.

To ensure proper synchronization between server instances, it is recommended to use a shared cache layer like Redis or Memcached.

## WebSocket Integration

Minute Server supports WebSocket integration to enable real-time communication between clients and the server. The server uses the `actix-web` and `actix` libraries to handle WebSocket connections.

To enable WebSocket support, use the `/ws` endpoint provided by the server. Clients can connect to this endpoint and exchange real-time messages using the WebSocket protocol. The server broadcasts messages to relevant clients using the appropriate message routing logic.

## GraphQL API

The Minute Server package utilizes GraphQL for its API. GraphQL provides a flexible and efficient way to query and manipulate data. The server uses the `async-graphql` library for implementing the GraphQL API.

The GraphQL API provides various query and mutation operations to manage users, conversations, messages, and more. Detailed documentation for the GraphQL schema and available operations can be found at [https://minute-server-docs.example.com/graphql](https://minute-server-docs.example.com/graphql).

You can interact with the GraphQL API using a GraphQL client or tools like `curl` or `Postman`.

## Database Integration

Minute Server integrates with MongoDB to store user data, conversations, and messages. MongoDB provides a scalable and high-performance NoSQL database solution.

The server package uses the `mongodb` and `mongodb-driver-async` libraries to interact with MongoDB. It supports connection pooling and efficient query execution for optimal performance.

Ensure that you have a running instance of MongoDB accessible to the server. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the appropriate MongoDB connection string.
